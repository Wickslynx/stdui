# STDUI

STDUI is an lightweight cross plattform GUI framework designed to be easy-to-use.


# Building:
STDUI dosen't need to be built for locally running, if you want to install it on your computer:
```sudo ./install.sh```

# Including in your project:
You only need the "stdui" folder to be included. Please only include that for the most minimal size.
