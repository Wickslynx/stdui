# STDUI

**Version 1.0**

STDUI is a lightweight GUI framework that can be seen as an succesor to RoofNut, this time it's as minimal as possible and only using OpenGL and raw X11 or WIN32 API. It's an evolving library designed for high performance with a customizable, immediate-mode interface.

# Features:
Excellent speed.
Rich Widget support.
Cross plattform.


# Getting Started:


**1. Compile and build your application using STDUI.**
Build your application using *./install.sh*, include *<stdui/window.h>* and you are all set.

Compile command for gcc: gcc *path-to-your-file* -o *-your-executables-name-* -lGL -lX11 (Only needed on linux)

Please see the *docs* folder for further explanation and examples

*Note:* This is not needed, you only have to have the "stdui" folder included in your project.
